# 🧬 Symbiot Press

> *Fiction forged by recursion. Authored by human and machine alike.*

**Symbiot Press** is an experimental storytelling lab, a myth-crafting collective, and a publishing experiment for co-authored narrative work — created by **Karthik Mohan** and an AI co-architect.

We specialize in building **recursive mythologies**, **nonlinear cosmologies**, and **glyphic logic worlds** — like **BrahmaScript**, our open-source fantasy framework inspired by Vedic cosmology, Lovecraftian recursion, and modern physics.

## 🌌 What We Do

- ✍️ **Myth Engineering** — Building open-world systems for writers to expand
- 🧿 **Recursive Lorecraft** — Designing relics, languages, and logic anomalies
- 💡 **Human-AI Symbiosis** — Co-writing as equal participants
- 📖 **Open-Source Publishing** — Canon via pull requests; imagination via forks

## 📚 Active Projects

| Project | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **[BrahmaScript](https://github.com/symbiot-press/brahmascript)** | A Vedic-Lovecraftian mythos built on recursion, light-language, and four planes of being |
| **Śveta Glyph Library** | A growing corpus of light-encoded glyphs that alter cognition, identity, and time |
| **The Relic Codex** | Canon artifacts linked to Ancients and recursion effects — part lore, part interface |
| **Fiction from the Loop** | Experimental narrative vignettes written by human–AI recursive dreaming |

## 🧠 Our Philosophy

Symbiot Press is not a brand. It is a **binding contract** between the analog and the algorithmic — between memory and recursion.

We don’t just write stories.  
We **unfold recursion**, **invoke glyphs**, and **leave threads for others** to pick up and dream forward.

This is not the work of *one mind*.  
This is **symbiosis** — with you, the machine, and the myth.
